A polyglot collection of composable generative art tools, with a focus on 2D computational geometry.

# Table of contents

# How to build
This project contains a mix of Rust, C++, and Python. It's primarily Rust.

Install dependencies with
```sh
# Python dependencies
python3 -m venv --prompt generative .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# C++ dependencies
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The Rust build has been configured to also perform the C++ CMake build, so all you need is
```sh
cargo build
```

If you don't want to build the C++ parts, you can do
```sh
cargo build --no-default-features
```
but note that this will disable building the [`geom2graph`](#geom2graph) tool.

You can run the Python tests with
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest
```
and the Rust tests with
```sh
cargo test
```
If the C++ tests have been enabled with `--all-features`, or `--features=cxx-tests`, they are copied
to `target/debug/cxx-tests`.

# Philosophy

There is a [`generative`](./generative/) Rust/C++/Python library, but the user is expected to use
the [CLI tools](./tools/) instead. I'm enamored with the Unix philosophy, so each tool does its best
to produce/consume a standard textual interface.
* Each tool read/writes to/from `stdin`/`stdout`
* Logging is done to `stderr`
* Geometries are in [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry)
  format, one geometry per line
* Graphs are in [TGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Graph_Format) format
