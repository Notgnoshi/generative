# geom2graph

A CLI application to convert geometries into a graph data structure.

---

For reasons I don't fully understand, the current implementation requires an unstable feature.
Install the nightly release and set it as the project default:

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
# In the generative/tools/geom2graph/ directory.
rustup override set nightly
```
